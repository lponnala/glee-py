calculate mean,stdev row-wise
find rows where mean is positive, take log of mean and stdev for those rows
pick rows that have finite log-stdev and the corresponding means
sort xbar values (and stdev values in the same order)
divide the total number of xbar values into p bins of equal size
take median (or any specific quantile) of xbar (X), stdev (Y) values in each bin
keep only finite values of X and Y, ensure they are of equal length
fit a straight line or cubic polynomial to X,Y (check with matlab)
identify stdev values that are within 5 stdevs of their mean (not xbar!) for plotting
overlay plot of the identified points along with the fit curve
add legend to the plot showing R^2 from curve fit

for adaptive binning, same as above except:
divide the range of sorted_xbar_values into p equal divisions and identify xbar,stdev values within each of them
merge the low-signal bins so that the lowest one contains atleast fbL of the proteins
merge the high-signal bins so that the highest one contains atleast fbH of the proteins
