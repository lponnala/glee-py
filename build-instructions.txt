
Installation steps on Windows:
1. Download the compressed .tar.gz file and extract its contents : http://www.pyinstaller.org/
2. Install PyWin32 : http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/

The folder pyinstaller-2.0 has been copied to C:\ for easier use (and to avoid deeply nested folders, as the documentation advises)
Adding "C:\pyinstaller-2.0" to my windows PATH is *not* necessary

Getting it up and running has been fairly easy, here's a simple command that'll create an all-in-one executable from a python script:
U:\Users\VAMS820\CODE\Python>python C:\pyinstaller-2.0\pyinstaller.py --onefile --noconsole --icon=rbc.ico display.py

The script in the above command line (display.py) creates a GUI using Tkinter, and it is rolled into one (somewhat big) executable which
(1) has the icon as specified (see http://converticon.com/ for creating an icon out of a regular image)
(2) doesn't pop up the windows console when double-clicked

Some other options you might want to use on the above command line:
	--clean : remove temp files before building
	--name : to assign a name to the created executable file
	--runtime-hook : code to set up special features of the runtime environment
	--r : include an exe file
